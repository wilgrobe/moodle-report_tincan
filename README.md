moodle-report_tincan
====================

This project is a fork of garemoko/moodle-report_tincan to bring it up to speed. Question level reporting has been added, but requires changes to the moodle core, specifically, the addition of specific events and triggers. That code is located at wilgrobe/moodle and hopefully, will eventually find it's way into production moodle code.
